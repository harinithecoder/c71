      <p class="text-muted">Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible.</p>

      <p class="text-muted">Darjeeling is a town in India's West Bengal state, in the Himalayan foothills. Once a summer resort for the British Raj elite, it remains the terminus of the narrow-gauge Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, or “Toy Train,” completed in 1881. It's famed for the distinctive black tea grown on plantations that dot its surrounding slopes. Its backdrop is Mt. Kanchenjunga, among the world’s highest peaks.</p>

          Marvel Studios’ “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings” is the latest modern-day extension to the MCU? Guided to craft beautifully by Destin Daniel Cretton. Shang-Chi has a massive soulfulness that future MCU movies need to take notes on and that only Black Panther did so memorably. It occurred to me while watching this movie that it is genuinely no longer about the characters we focus on, but it is their adventure toward locating themselves, and we follow that adventure here in an amazing Superhero Oriental Fantasy blockbuster. Noticeably, the VFX, scene sets, costume designs, and the special effects themselves incredibly heightened the impact of the movie and allowed a symbolic impact on the awe-inspiring production value and, as a result, the aforementioned movie knocked out in dazzling heights on a beautiful scale because of the VFX. The movement sequences and choreography are polished and stunning. Narratively, the storyline continues incredibly, and we understand the moments of humour the MCU is so well-known for, and we are all here for it. This film divided me going to the cinema and waiting for a digital component! Because of COVID-19, however, I didn’t need to have the entirety of Shang-Chi spoiled earlier on with leaks, thank goodness I went to the very first showing on the opening Thursday night, I have experienced Shang-Chi several times now and in extraordinarily different formats including 4D-X. This movie displays some of the most remarkably phenomenal combat performances in a Marvel movie I had never seen in this noticeable approach previously. The movie is formulaic and well-trodden territory for Marvel and has several exceptional visual effects layered in. Shang-Chi is such an enchanting movie to watch and even better on the biggest screen you can find, keeping safety in mind at all times! If you have seen Marvel movies consistently, you’ve got to know that the narrative is a predictable storyline for Marvel’s superhero foundation adventures. This film is full of numerous great moments, with its battle sequences and action set pieces, which is arguably undoubtedly its major attraction. But Shang-Chi has given us some outstanding personalities and characters in a live-action film like Black Panther’s did so on his solitary quest. Marvel Studios’ Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is one of the most exceptional superhero movies I’ve watched in years, if not in the past decade. Simu Liu and Meng’er Zhang and Tony Leung Chiu Wai get considerable distinct and exceptional choreographed action choreography that we have not witnessed since Captain America: Winter Soldier. There is not any one thing like Shang-Chi I have seen before in the MCU, this film seems fresh. Shang-Chi feeds us with the deprived traditional antique sequences of martial craftsmanship, which we appreciate a lot as an audience and applauds in an incredible modern depiction. This is one of the better, exceptional Marvel films ever. I would recommend watching this one.

          The action sequences give plenty of thrilling moments, and I must add that it is worth seeing more than once. KGF 2 is propelled along by the impressive performances of its talented cast. Having said so, the protagonist and adversary remain the focus of attention throughout the film.
